In contrast, progeny virus was efficiently released from the apical cell surface. Further, we determined the roles of the glycoprotein, matrix protein, and nucleoprotein in directed release of nascent virus. To do this, a virus-like-particle assay was developed in polarized MDCK cells based on the finding that, when expressed individually, both the glycoprotein GP and matrix protein Z form virus-like particles.

We find that distances and angles in the primary coordination sphere are in general close to the expected (or ideal) values. Deviations occur primarily for oxygen coordinating atoms and are found to be mainly due to H-bonding of the oxygen coordinating ligand to protein residues, bidentate binding arrangements, and multi-zinc sites. We find that H-bonding of oxygen containing residues (or water) to zinc bound histidines is almost universal in our dataset and defines the elec-His-Zn motif. Analysis of the stereochemistry shows that carboxyl elec-His-Zn motifs are geometrically rigid, while water elec-His-Zn motifs show the most geometrical variation. As catalytic motifs have a higher proportion of carboxyl elec atoms than structural motifs, they provide a more rigid framework for zinc binding. This is understood biologically, as a small distortion in the zinc position in an enzyme can have serious consequences on the enzymatic reaction.

The viruses may also invade the brain to establish persistent infections, triggering fatal complications, such as subacute sclerosis pan-encephalitis (SSPE) in MeV infection or chronic, multiple sclerosis-like, multifocal demyelinating lesions in the case of CDV infection. In both diseases, persistence is mediated by viral nucleocapsids that do not require packaging into particles for infectivity but are directly transmitted from cell to cell (neurons in SSPE or astrocytes in distemper encephalitis), presumably by relying on restricted microfusion events. Indeed, although morphological evidence of fusion remained undetectable, viral fusion machineries and, thus, a putative cellular receptor, were shown to contribute to persistent infections. Here, we first showed that nectin-4-dependent cell-cell fusion in Vero cells, triggered by a demyelinating CDV strain, remained extremely limited, thereby supporting a potential role of nectin-4 in mediating persistent infections in astrocytes. However, nectin-4 could not be detected in either primary cultured astrocytes or the white matter of tissue sections. In addition, a bioengineered \"nectin-4-blind\" recombinant CDV retained full cell-to-cell transmission efficacy in primary astrocytes. Combined with our previous report demonstrating the absence of SLAM expression in astrocytes, these findings are suggestive for the existence of a hitherto unrecognized third CDV receptor expressed by glial cells that contributes to the induction of noncytolytic cell-to-cell viral transmission in astrocytes. While persistent measles virus (MeV) infection induces SSPE in humans, persistent canine distemper virus (CDV) infection causes chronic progressive or relapsing demyelination in carnivores. Common to both central nervous system (CNS) infections is that persistence is based on noncytolytic cell-to-cell spread, which, in the case of CDV, was demonstrated to rely on functional membrane fusion machinery complexes. This inferred a mechanism where nucleocapsids are transmitted through macroscopically invisible microfusion events between infected and target cells. Here, we provide evidence that CDV induces such microfusions in a SLAM- and nectin-4-independent manner, thereby strongly suggesting the existence of a third receptor expressed in glial cells (referred to as GliaR).

However, secondary infection of activated T cells from infected DC could cause dissemination of virus and loss of infected DC and T cells. In asymptomatic infection, fewer dendritic cells with reduced capacity to stimulate CD4 T cell proliferation are found before evidence of T cell abnormalities, and these early changes in antigen-presenting cells may result in a decline in the production of CD4 memory T cells. However, DC fuel ongoing production of antibody to HIV-1.

However, secondary infection of activated T cells from infected DC could cause dissemination of virus and loss of infected DC and T cells. In asymptomatic infection, fewer dendritic cells with reduced capacity to stimulate CD4 T cell proliferation are found before evidence of T cell abnormalities, and these early changes in antigen-presenting cells may result in a decline in the production of CD4 memory T cells. However, DC fuel ongoing production of antibody to HIV-1. Signaling by DC to T cells may thus underlie two major features of early HIV infection--loss in CD4+ memory T cells and persistence of antibody production. In AIDS, infected dendritic and epithelial cells within the thymus may affect maturation and contribute to loss of the \"naive\" T cell population. Further loss of memory T cells may occur through syncytium formation with infected DC. Finally, in AIDS patients, there is a failure in the development and the function of DC from CD34+ stem cells.

Three low-passage Lassa virus strains (AV, NL, and CSF), isolated from humans with mild to fulminant Lassa fever, were tested. Lassa virus replication was inhibited by IFN-alpha and IFN-gamma, but not TNF-alpha, in Huh7 and Vero cells. The degree of IFN sensitivity of a Lassa virus isolate did not correlate with disease severity in human patients. Furthermore, cytokine effects observed for Lassa virus and LCMV (strains CH-5692, Armstrong, and WE) were similar.

Both proteins reside in PML bodies, a cellular target of the LCMV and Lassa virus Z proteins. Overexpression of PML or Sp100 did not affect replication of either virus.

Given the ecology of the rodent host and conditions in the endemic area, a vaccine is mandatory for control. The challenge is to overcome the scientific, political and economic obstacles to producing a human use vaccine candidate. There are some scientific issues to resolve. It is known that the G-protein confers protection but we do not know its duration. If the N-protein is also included there may be a better duration of protection but it is unclear whether the N-protein as a vaccine may possibly enhance the infection. The original vaccinia vector must be replaced by new vectors, chimeras or by delivering DNA in some format. A live vaccine is attractive because it can confer protection in a single shot. A killed vaccine is more stable, particularly for distribution in the tropics but usually requires repeated shots.

Targeting these populations stands to reduce tumor recurrence and offer the promise of more complete therapy. Thus, improving access to the tumor, while leaving normal brain tissue unscathed, is a critical pursuit. A central challenge in this endeavor lies in the limited delivery of therapeutics to the tumor itself. The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is responsible for much of this difficulty but also provides an essential separation from systemic circulation. Due to the BBB's physical and chemical constraints, many current therapies, from cytotoxic drugs to antibody-based proteins, cannot gain access to the tumor. This review describes the characteristics of the BBB and associated changes wrought by the presence of a tumor.

The crystal structure of the antigen-binding fragment (Fab) of B2212A, the monoclonal antibody against the third Fn domain (Fn3) of ROBO1, was determined in pursuit of antibody drug for hepatocellular carcinoma. This effort was conducted in the presence or absence of the antigen, with the chemical features being investigated by determining the affinity of the antibody using molecular dynamics (MD) and thermodynamics. The structural comparison of B2212A Fab between the complex and the free form revealed that the interfacial Tyr(L) 50 (superscripts L, H, and F stand for the residues in the light chain, heavy chain, and Fn3, respectively) played important roles in Fn3 recognition. That is, the aromatic ring of Tyr(L) 50 pivoted toward Phe(F) 68, forming a CH/\\xcf\\x80 interaction and a new hydrogen bond with the carbonyl O atom of Phe(F) 68. MD simulations predicted that the Tyr(L) 50-Phe(F) 68 interaction almost entirely dominated Fab-Fn3 binding, and Ala-substitution of Tyr(L) 50 led to a reduced binding of the resultant complex. On the contrary, isothermal titration calorimetry experiments underscored that Ala-substitution of Tyr(L) 50 caused an increase of the binding enthalpy between B2212A and Fn3, but importantly, it induced an increase of the binding entropy, resulting in a suppression of loss in the Gibbs free energy in total.

Several LASV receptors, including dystroglycan (DG), TAM receptor tyrosine kinases, and C-type lectins, have been identified, suggesting complex receptor use. Upon receptor binding, LASV enters the host cell via an unknown clathrin- and dynamin-independent pathway that delivers the virus to late endosomes, where fusion occurs. Here we investigated the mechanisms underlying LASV endocytosis in human cells in the context of productive arenavirus infection, using recombinant lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (rLCMV) expressing the LASV glycoprotein (rLCMV-LASVGP). We found that rLCMV-LASVGP entered human epithelial cells via DG using a macropinocytosis-related pathway independently of alternative receptors. Dystroglycan-mediated entry of rLCMV-LASVGP required sodium hydrogen exchangers, actin, and the GTPase Cdc42 and its downstream targets, p21-activating kinase-1 (PAK1) and Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (N-Wasp). Unlike other viruses that enter cells via macropinocytosis, rLCMV-LASVGP entry did not induce overt changes in cellular morphology and hardly affected actin dynamics or fluid uptake. Screening of kinase inhibitors identified protein kinase C, phosphoinositide 3-kinase, and the receptor tyrosine kinase human hepatocyte growth factor receptor (HGFR) to be regulators of rLCMV-LASVGP entry. The HGFR inhibitor EMD 1214063, a candidate anticancer drug, showed antiviral activity against rLCMV-LASVGP at the level of entry. When combined with ribavirin, which is currently used to treat human arenavirus infection, EMD 1214063 showed additive antiviral effects. In sum, our study reveals that DG can link LASV to an unusual pathway of macropinocytosis that causes only minimal perturbation of the host cell and identifies cellular kinases to be possible novel targets for therapeutic intervention. Lassa virus (LASV) causes several hundred thousand infections per year in Western Africa, with the mortality rate among hospitalized patients being high. The current lack of a vaccine and the limited therapeutic options at hand make the development of new drugs against LASV a high priority. In the present study, we uncover that LASV entry into human cells via its major receptor, dystroglycan, involves an unusual pathway of macropinocytosis and define a set of cellular factors implicated in the regulation of LASV entry. A screen of kinase inhibitors revealed HGFR to be a possible candidate target for antiviral drugs against LASV. An HGFR candidate inhibitor currently being evaluated for cancer treatment showed potent antiviral activity and additive drug effects with ribavirin, which is used in the clinic to treat human LASV infection.

In cells infected with VACV lacking gene B14R (vDeltaB14) there was a higher level of phosphorylated IkappaBalpha but a similar level of IkappaBalpha compared to cells infected with control viruses expressing B14, suggesting B14 affects IKK activity. Direct evidence for this was obtained by showing that B14 co-purified and co-precipitated with the endogenous IKK complex from human and mouse cells and inhibited IKK complex enzymatic activity. Notably, the interaction between B14 and the IKK complex required IKKbeta but not IKKalpha, suggesting the interaction occurs via IKKbeta.
